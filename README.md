# Task 03 - Text Generation with Markov Chains

### 📌 Task Description

This task involves implementing a **simple text generation algorithm using Markov Chains**.  
A Markov Chain is a statistical model that predicts the probability of the next word or character based on the previous one(s).  
The goal is to generate coherent text using learned transition probabilities from a given dataset.


### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Google Colab  
- Basic Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Markov Chain Algorithm


# 📂 Project Structure

### 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Upload `prodigy3.ipynb`  
   **OR** open it directly using the GitHub notebook URL
3. Run all cells step by step
4. Provide input text (training corpus)
5. Generated text will be displayed as output


### 📝 Algorithm Overview

- Input text is tokenized into words
- Transition probabilities are calculated
- A Markov Chain model is created
- New text is generated based on learned probabilities


### 📊 Output Information
✅ **All generated text outputs are displayed inside the Google Colab notebook**  
📌 Notebook name: **`prodigy3.ipynb`**

> Note: GitHub may not render notebook outputs correctly.  
> To view full results, **open and run the notebook in Google Colab**.


### 🧠 Example Output

- Random text generated based on training corpus
- Output varies each time due to probabilistic selection


### 📎 Notes

- No external ML models are used
- Purely statistical approach
- Beginner-friendly implementation
- Well-commented code for clarity


### ✅ Task Completion

This project fulfills **Prodigy Internship – Task 03** requirements by:
- Implementing Markov Chains from scratch
- Generating text probabilistically
- Demonstrating outputs in a runnable Colab notebook
